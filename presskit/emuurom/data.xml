  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.
    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:
    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```
    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.
    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:
    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```
    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._
    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.
    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    EMUUROM ("eh-moo rom") is an upcoming nonviolent creature-scanning metroidvania. 

    You are MAIRE ("my-rhe"), a red-haired retrobiologist willingly trapped in an unknown world, inhabited by mostly peaceful creatures called EMUUROM. You are only equipped with a data-gathering SKANNER' BEAM that you can use to explore the ecosystem.

    Instead of powering up, you have to comprehend the creatures - and use their special abilities to advance! Open up new paths, meet cute creatures, and sleep under the starry sky... but beware: on the horizon, a comet called THE RED INTERLOPER is inching closer, threatening the peaceful world. Overcome the obstacles and master the mysteries, and you might be able to save the species - and yourself.

    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.
    You have two possibilities here.
    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.
    You can't have both.
    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.

  <history>
    EMUUROM is the first game on Steam created with the tiny TIC-80 fantasy console. It started its life as a jam game for Fantasy Console jam 3 in early 2018. The first demo was released on Itch.io in early 2020, and later that year it was a part of the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality. A new, polished demo was released on Steam in August 2021, and it participated in the Steam Next Fest in October.

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.
    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.
    This is this the place to do it.
    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.
    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.
    The <link> tag is optional.
