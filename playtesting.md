# Playtesting EMUUROM

Playtesting EMUUROM is conducted remotely, whenever it suits you. In a nutshell:

1. Record a video of you playing the game
2. Comment aloud your feelings during the playthrough
3. Send the recording to me.

## Setup

Before actually starting the playtest, get your recording setup ready:

* an okay-ish computer with Windows, Mac or Linux
* a **microphone** to record your voice
* a **controller** or a **keyboard** to play the game
* the **development build** of EMUUROM
  * Download it at [emuurom.com/devbuild](https://www.emuurom.com/devbuild)

The instructions below describe how to record your computer screen. If that's no issue, jump into the next section: [Let's get started](#lets-get-started).

## Test run

To make sure your recording setup works:

1. Open EMUUROM into the *CONTROLS* screen.
2. Start recording.
3. Fiddle with either 
     * the directional pad on the controller 
     * the arrow keys on the keyboard
4. Say something to the mic.
5. Stop recording and confirm that the recorded video features
     * a fully visible game screen 
     * your voice
     * the sound played when the buttons were pressed

And you're good to go!

## Tips for playtesting

* Aim to articulate your thoughts continuously! When in doubt, try to answer these three questions:
  1. What do you see on screen?
  2. How do you interpret it?
  3. How does it make you feel?
* Remember, the game is still incomplete
  * It's not your fault if you get lost or confused at any point, but rather the game's!
* You are not being tested - *you* are testing *the game*.
* You don't need to complete the game on one sitting. Only play for as long as you feel like!
  * In fact, the length of a play session is meaningful information.

## After recording

After every recording session, send the recorded video to me. I've sent you a link to a shared Google Drive folder, where you can upload the file.

Let me know when the file is uploaded. If there's something on your mind that you didn't articulate during the playtesting, you can write it in the email.

***GDPR notice:*** Because I use Google Drive, the video is shared with Google - but not with any other party. The video will only be used for playtesting purposes. If you wish to request a copy of the data and/or get it deleted, send an email to:
