# Playtesting EMUUROM

Playtesting EMUUROM is conducted remotely, whenever it suits you. In a nutshell, you

* record a video of you playing the game
* comment aloud your feelings
* after it's done, send the recording to me.

---

## Setup

Before actually starting the playtest, get your recording setup ready. 

You will need:
* an okay-ish computer with Windows, Mac or Linux
* a **microphone** to record your voice
* a **controller** or a **keyboard** to play the game
* the **development build** of EMUUROM
  * Download it at [emuurom.com/devbuild](https://www.emuurom.com/devbuild)

The instructions below describe how to record your computer screen.

### Windows

1. Press *Win+G* to open the Xbox Game Bar.
2. Press the microphone button to turn mic on while recording.
3. Press the record button (the circle) to start recording.
   * Note: You can also use *Win+Alt+R* to start/stop recording.
4. Press *Win+G* again to close the Xbox Game Bar.

Windows saves your captures to the `Videos/Captures` folder.

## Let's get started

To make sure your recording setup works, open EMUUROM and take a short test recording of the CONFIG screen that appears when you open the game.

1. Press either 
  * the directional pad on the controller 
  * the arrow keys on the keyboard
2. Say something to the mic.
3. Stop recording and confirm that the recorded video features
  * a fully visible game screen 
  * your voice
  * the sound played when the buttons were pressed

And now, you're good to go!

## Tips for playtesting

* Aim to articulate your thoughts continuously! When in doubt, try to answer these three questions:
  1. What do you see on screen?
  2. How do you interpret it?
  3. How does it make you feel?
* Remember, the game is still incomplete
  * It's not your fault if you get lost or confused at any point, but rather the game's!
* You are not being tested - *you* are testing *the game*.
* You don't need to complete the game on one sitting. Only play for as long as you feel like!
  * In fact, the time you want to take to play the game is meaningful information.

## After it's done

After every recording session, send the recorded video to me. I've sent you a link to a shared Google Drive folder, where you can upload the file.

***GDPR notice:*** Because I use Google Drive, the video is shared with Google - but not with any other party. The video will only be used for playtesting purposes. I will analyse the video and make adjustments to the game based on it. If you wish to request a copy of the data and/or get it deleted, send an email to:
