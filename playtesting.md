Playtesting EMUUROM is conducted remotely, whenever it suits you. In a nutshell, you

* record a video of you playing the game
* comment aloud your feelings
* after it's done, send the recording to me.

## Setup

Before actually starting the playtest, get your recording setup ready. 

You will need:
* an okay-ish computer with Windows, Mac or Linux
* a **microphone** to record your voice
* a **controller** or a **keyboard** to play the game
* the **development build** of EMUUROM
  * Download it at [emuurom.com/devbuild](https://www.emuurom.com/devbuild)

The instructions below describe how to record your computer screen.

## Let's get started

To make sure your recording setup works, open EMUUROM and take a short test recording of the CONFIG screen that appears when you open the game.

* Press either 
  * the directional pad on the controller 
  * the arrow keys on the keyboard
* Say something to the mic.
* Confirm that the record contains
  * a fully visible game screen 
  * your voice
  * the sound played when the buttons were pressed

And now, you're good to go!
