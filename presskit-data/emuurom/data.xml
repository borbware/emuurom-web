    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.
    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:
    ```
    DLC of:

    ```
    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._
    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    EMUUROM is a nonviolent creature-scanning exploration platformer, where you document an ancient paradise before it's lost forever.
    EMUUROM is a rule-discovery game ("metroidbrainia") in the vein of Animal Well, Void Stranger and Tunic: knowledge opens new paths.
    Equipped with a unique SCANNER BEAM, you reveal hidden pathways and study the EMUUROM creatures to gain knowledge and create new paths forward.
    The environmental puzzles range from obvious to obscure, with a plethora of secrets hidden in plain sight:
    this creates a multi-layered experience for many kinds of players.
    As you gain a better understanding on the world around you, the machinations of the EMUUROM creatures begin to unfold...

  <history>
    EMUUROM is created with the TIC-80 fantasy console, a game engine with idiosyncratic retro restrictions, like Pico-8.
    
    EMUUROM's demo was the first TIC-80 game on Steam, and it started its life as a jam game for the Fantasy Console jam 3 in early 2018.
    
    The first post-jam demo was released on Itch.io in 2020, and later that year, the demo was a part of the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality.
    
    A new demo was released on Steam in Fall 2021 for the Steam Next Fest.
    
    I've documented the development process and new demo updates in my Itch.io devlog (link at the bottom).
    
    EMUUROM has been featured in multiple events, including Thinky Direct 2025, Busan Indie Connect, Nordic Game Conference, Pocket Gamer Connects and multiple Cerebral Puzzle Showcases.

        The energy of the game is certainly different from other titles. Cozier and inquisitive, it appeals to a more academic mindset that adores the surprise that video games can deliver. It's a medium that can be anything that you can possibly fathom. Emuurom embodies this at its core

        This is actually one of my most anticipated games out of like, all of them. [...]
        There are so many metroidvanias out there that feel like they're going down a checklist, and EMUUROM feels like something really fresh.
        [It] makes me feel like I can still be excited about video games.
