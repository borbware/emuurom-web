  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.
    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:
    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```
    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.
    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:
    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```
    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._
    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.
    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    EMUUROM ("eh-moo-rom") is an upcoming nonviolent creature-scanning exploration platformer, where you document an ancient paradise before it's lost forever. 
    
    You are MAIRE ("my-rhe"), a red-haired retrobiologist who's trapped herself in an unknown world, inhabited by mostly peaceful creatures called EMUUROM. 

    Equipped with a data-gathering SCANNER BEAM, you study the behaviour of the EMUUROM creatures and use the gained knowledge to create new paths forward. Slowly, the machinations of the mythic forest sprites begin to unfold.

  <history>
    EMUUROM is created with the TIC-80 fantasy console, an engine with idiosyncratic retro restrictions. EMUUROM is the first TIC-80 game on Steam, and it started its life as a jam game for the Fantasy Console jam 3 in early 2018. The first post-jam demo with a refined concept was released on Itch.io in early 2020, and later that year EMUUROM was a part of the Bundle for Racial Justice and Equality. A new, polished demo was released on Steam in August 2021, and it participated in the Steam Next Fest in October. Ever since, the demo has received updates on Itch and Steam as the game has evolved, and I've documented the development process in my devlog on Itch. In 2023, EMUUROM was featured in the Busan Indie Connect festival, Cerebral Puzzle Showcase, Games Gathering 2023 Kyiv and DreamHack Beyond Summer Indie Showcase.

      <description>EMUUROM brought me back to the golden age of indie Flash games – it's a beautifully crafted, creative, exploration-focused experience full of secrets and cozy feelings.</description>

        The energy of the game is certainly different from other titles. Cozier and inquisitive, it appeals to a more academic mindset that adores the surprise that video games can deliver. It's a medium that can be anything that you can possibly fathom. Emuurom embodies this at its core

        This is actually one of my most anticipated games out of like, all of them. [...]
        There are so many metroidvanias out there that feel like they're going down a checklist, and EMUUROM feels like something really fresh.
        [It] makes me feel like I can still be excited about video games.
