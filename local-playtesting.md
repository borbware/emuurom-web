# Playtesting EMUUROM

Thank you for playtesting EMUUROM! Here are some general instructions...

## Setup

* Go to https://borbware.itch.io/emuurom to play the web build or download a native build for Windows, Mac or Linux.
* On less powerful hardware, the native builds generally perform better than the web build. 

## Info

* Press *Alt+Enter* to enter fullscreen mode.
* Controls are explained in-game - you can use either controller or keyboard, whichever you like.
* The game saves progress on specific occasions, both on web and native versions.
* If you absolutely must, controls can also be remapped from the pause menu (ESC key / Back button)

## The playtest session

The demo is just about identical with the beginning of the full game. The game will tell you when you have reached the end.

To make the most out of the playtesting, consider these aspects when playing the demo...
  1. What do you see on screen?
  2. How do you interpret it?
  3. How does it make you feel?

* Remember: the game is still very incomplete. It's not your fault if you get lost or confused at any point, but rather the game designer's!
* You are not the one being tested - *you* are testing *the game*.

Thanks for playtesting! Wishlist EMUUROM!
